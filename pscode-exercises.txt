// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

    int a = x
    int b = y
    int sum = x + y

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

    int sum == (a + b) 
    if sum / 2 = whole number no remainder
       print even
    if sum / 2 = has a remainder
       print odd
    
// Exercise 3: Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
    a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
    READ:
        int num1
        int num2
        int num3
        int num4
        int num5
    
    b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
        SUM COUNT = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)
        AVERAGE = SUM COUNT / 5
    
    c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
        MinValue = MIN (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)
        MaxValue = MAX (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)
    
    d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
        PRINT: "The average of the [SUM COUNT] numbers is: [AVERAGE], with the smallest number = [MinValue] and the largest value = [MaxValue]
